## About StudyPods v3.0

Study pods is an initiative taken by DSC MBM to promote peer-to-peer learning among the students with a notion that says “Learn Together, Build Together”.The program is designed to offer participants a good exposure of technology and the technical world. It is an approx one month-long program that connects like-minded participants interested in a particular domain to come together, learn together and then build together. StudyPod mentors assist participants with the roadmap, resources, take weekly updates and solve doubts which cannot be solved by the team members. At the end of the program each StudyPod needs to submit a project or a propsal for a paper that showcases their learnings during the program.

## Weekly/Monthly Logs

Weekly Logs is an important activity planned by DSC MBM to motivate participants to note their progress and prepare the log for future generation to plan accordingly.

### Format

The log should follow this structure

```
Date:

  Team Member1:

## Project

This section contains the details about the different projects made by the team.

The purpose of this project was to implement various data structures and algorithms in C++, using code to illustrate their functionality. The project involved implementing classes and methods for data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, as well as implementing algorithms such as sorting, searching, insertion and deletion.

1. Array: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored in contiguous memory locations. They are used to store and manipulate data efficiently, especially when the number of elements is fixed.

2.Linked List: A linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes that contain data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It allows dynamic memory allocation and is useful when the number of elements is not fixed.

3.Stack using Array: A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. A stack using an array is an implementation of a stack where elements are pushed and popped from one end of the array.

4.Stack using Linked List: A stack using a linked list is another implementation of a stack where elements are pushed and popped from the head of the linked list.

5.Queue using Array: A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. A queue using an array is an implementation of a queue where elements are enqueued at the rear and dequeued from the front of the array.

6.Queue using Linked List: A queue using a linked list is another implementation of a queue where elements are enqueued at the rear and dequeued from the head of the linked list.

7.Tree: A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Some types of trees implemented in the project include Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Binary Tree, and Binary Search Tree (BST). BFS and DFS are traversal algorithms used to search or visit all the nodes in a tree. A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children, while a binary search tree is a binary tree where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
