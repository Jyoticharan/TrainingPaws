## About StudyPods v3.0

Study pods is an initiative taken by DSC MBM to promote peer-to-peer learning among the students with a notion that says “Learn Together, Build Together”.The program is designed to offer participants a good exposure of technology and the technical world. It is an approx one month-long program that connects like-minded participants interested in a particular domain to come together, learn together and then build together. StudyPod mentors assist participants with the roadmap, resources, take weekly updates and solve doubts which cannot be solved by the team members. At the end of the program each StudyPod needs to submit a project or a propsal for a paper that showcases their learnings during the program.

## Project

The project involves creating a job posting platform that utilizes Firebase as the backend to upload and fetch jobs. The platform is built using ReactJS, JavaScript, and Material UI. With this platform, users can create and job seekers can apply for jobs posted on the platform.

Firebase is a popular backend platform that allows users to store and sync data in real-time. It is easy to use and provides a range of services, including authentication, database management, and hosting.

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It provides a declarative approach to building UI components and manages the state of the application. ReactJS enables developers to build reusable components that can be used across the entire application.

JavaScript is a programming language that is used for both front-end and back-end development. It is used to add interactivity to web pages and provides the logic for web applications. JavaScript enables developers to build complex applications with dynamic user interfaces.

Material UI is a React-based UI library that provides pre-built components for creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces. Material UI is designed to be easy to use and provides a range of customization options. It allows developers to build responsive and accessible user interfaces with ease.
