## About StudyPods v3.0

Study pods is an initiative taken by DSC MBM to promote peer-to-peer learning among the students with a notion that says ‚ÄúLearn Together, Build Together‚Äù.The program is designed to offer participants a good exposure of technology and the technical world. It is an approx one month-long program that connects like-minded participants interested in a particular domain to come together, learn together and then build together. StudyPod mentors assist participants with the roadmap, resources, take weekly updates and solve doubts which cannot be solved by the team members. At the end of the program each StudyPod needs to submit a project or a propsal for a paper that showcases their learnings during the program.

## Project

This section contains the details about the different projects made by the team.

### Project 1

Stock Prediction Model <br>

Stock Prediction project using machine learning involves collecting and preprocessing historical stock market data, selecting relevant features, choosing a machine learning algorithm, training and evaluating the model, and deploying it to predict future stock prices.

### Project 2

Book Recommendation system <br>

Created A book recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). It involves nvolves collecting book information and user ratings, preprocessing the data, fitting a KNN model, predicting ratings for the testing set, evaluating the model's performance, and recommending books to users based on the model's predictions.

### Project 3

Tic-Tac-Toe game

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and Pygame. It allows the player to play against the computer or against another player. The computer uses the minimax algorithm to make moves. 


### Project 4

QR Code Scanner and Reader

This project is a QR code scanner and reader that can read QR codes from images and live camera feeds.
