## About The Project

A book recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This involves collecting book information and user ratings, preprocessing the data, fitting a KNN model, predicting ratings for the testing set, evaluating the model's performance, and recommending books to users based on the model's predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. KNN algo 
4. Numpy 

### Usage
To use a book recommendation system based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the book recommendation system.

2. The system will ask you to input some information about your reading preferences, such as your favorite genres, authors, or books.

3. Based on your input, the system will search for books in its database that match your preferences.

4. The system will use the KNN algorithm to find books that are similar to the ones you like. This algorithm looks for books that have similar attributes, such as genre, author, topic, or language.

5. The system will recommend books that are similar to the ones you like and that you may enjoy reading.

6. You can browse through the recommended books and select the ones that interest you.

7. If you read a recommended book, you can rate it or give feedback to the system. This will help the system to improve its recommendations in the future.

8. The system will update its recommendations based on your feedback and the feedback of other users.
